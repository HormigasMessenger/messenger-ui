// "Sticky" chats: DIRECT conversations the user has engaged with (opened/created) stay in their list
// even when EMPTY. The backend hides message-less conversations from GET /api/chats (by design), so a
// chat you created but never messaged — or whose messages you later deleted one by one — silently
// disappears. We remember it locally and merge it back into the list (see useContacts); it's dropped
// only when the user explicitly deletes the chat (the ✕). Groups are never stickied — they come from
// GET /api/groups regardless of activity. Persisted to localStorage; cleared on logout.
