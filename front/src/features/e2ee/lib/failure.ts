// skip ceiling, (b) classifies a raw libsignal decrypt error into a small, meaningful set, and (c) maps a
// message's crypto outcome to the single string the user sees. Keeping it here — not scattered across the
// chat middleware — is what makes the failure modes auditable and testable.

// The library (@privacyresearch/libsignal-protocol-typescript, session-cipher.js) hard-caps a single
// forward fill at 2000 keys ("Over 2000 messages into the future!") and self-evicts old chains/sessions
// (OLD_RATCHETS_MAX_LENGTH=10, ARCHIVED_STATES_MAX_LENGTH=40). So skipped-key memory is bounded WITHOUT us
// forking the library; a gap wider than this is un-healable on the live chain and must go to recovery.
