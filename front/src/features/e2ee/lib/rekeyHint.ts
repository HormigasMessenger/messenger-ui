// Rekey hint: a metadata-only control frame a recipient device sends when it receives a secret envelope
// addressed to its USER but not to its own deviceId (a parallel/new device the sender didn't encrypt to).

// material and NO device id: acting on it only triggers a re-fetch from the auth-bound directory, so a
// spoofed hint can at most cause a bounded, rate-limited re-fetch — never a redirect to an attacker device.
// It rides the same opaque SIGNAL channel as calls / recovery (frameBridge routes the "e2ee:" prefix).
